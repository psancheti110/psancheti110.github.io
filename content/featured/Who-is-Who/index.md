Working with <b>Prof. Kamal Karlapalem</b> in developing an online directory <b>“Who-is-Who”</b> that helps <b>Consolidate Distinct Web Profiles sharing Identical Name</b> by leveraging state-of-the-art <b>Natural Language Processing</b> pipelines as well as <b>Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)</b> for increased accuracy and efficiency of the platform. It is a secure method to verify and monitor profiles associated with a given name, mitigating risks of identity theft and online fraud. Our work has been submitted to [The ACM Web Conference 2024 (ACM WWW ’24)]() for consideration.
